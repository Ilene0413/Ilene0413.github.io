          So where to begin, especially since I don't like writing about myself! 
          I am divorced for a little over a year, living by myself for the first time, and am loving it!
          I have 2 sons (28 and 24) and a dog named Cammie, that I love to take on long walks.  I also have a boyfriend for the past
          4 months, and if you would have told me that a year ago, I would have said you were crazy. The good thing is he makes
          me feel like I am 25.  
      </p>       
      
      <p>Now about me.  I am adventurous and love to try new things, which is why I enrolled in the bootcamp. I also enjoy
        amusement parks, especially riding the roller coasters.  I love to hike and recently took a hike in the Virgin River
        in Zion National Park (yes it was in the water and 50 degrees outside)
